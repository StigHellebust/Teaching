\section{Electronic structure, quantum numbers and energies}
\subsection{Quantum numbers}
\label{quantno}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Quantum numbers revisited}

There are four quantum numbers. We'll get back to them later, but for now let us accept that they describe the electronic structure of atoms and molecules, i.e. size and shape of the electronic orbitals. They are:

\begin{description}
\item[n :] This is the main energy level, or \textit{electron shell}. Higher numbers indicate higher energy levels and increasing distance form the nucleus. \(n \in [1,\rightarrow\rangle\)
\item[\(\ell\) :] This is the angular quantum number and it describes the shape of the electronic orbital. Also called \textit{subshell}. \(\ell \in [0,n-1]\). 
\item[\(m_\ell\) :] This is the magnetic quantum number. It describes the \textit{orientation} of the electronic orbital. \(m_\ell \in [-l,+l]\)
\item[\(m_s\) :] This is the electron \textit{spin}. \(s\in [-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]\)
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\subsubsection{Shells, orbitals, configurations and states}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Shells, Subshells, orbitals and electron configurations}

\medskip So there are multiple possible values and each unique combination can only describe one electron in an atom, i.e. no two electrons can have the same set of four numbers in the same atom.\newline
\vspace{1cm} \mode<presentation>{\tiny}
\begin{tabular}{lp{1cm}p{1.2cm}p{1.9in}|p{1.2cm}p{1.5cm}p{2cm}}
\textit{n} & \textit{orbitals} & name of orbital & orientations & \# \newline orbitals \newline (\(n^2\)) & \# electrons in orbitals (2(2\(\ell\) + 1) )& \# electrons in shell (\(2n^2\))\\\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
So each orbital is described by three numbers, \(n,\ \ell\) and \(m_\ell\).
\bigskip
Each electron is uniquely described by the four quantum numbers, including spin. For example, an electron described by the numbers \{n=3,\(\ell\)=1,\(m_\ell\)=-1,\(m_s = +\frac{1}{2}\)\} is an electron in the 3rd shell's \(p_x\)-orbital with spin up. Note that each orbital can accommodate 2 electrons if they have paired spin (\textit{paired} meaning \textit{opposite} spin, i.e. \(m_{s_1} \ne m_{s_2}\))\par
\bigskip
Each orbital characterised by particular values of n and \(\ell\) can accommodate 2(2\(\ell\) + 1) electrons, because \(m_\ell\) can take 2\(\ell\)+1 values and \(m_s\) can take 2.

\subsection{Energies}
\subsubsection{The quantum mechanical form of the energy}
\label{poly}
The energy can be described by the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates. The Hamiltonian is just an operator which considers the kinetic energies and the potential energies of a system. It was first used as a reformulation of Newtonian mechanics, but it is now very important in quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian describes the energy of a system.

\begin{frame}

\medskip For a \underline{Hydrogen atom:}
\[ H=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu}\bigtriangledown^2 - \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r}\]
where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\)\newline\medskip \(\mu = \) reduced mass \(=\frac{m_em_p}{m_e+m_p}\). \(m_e\) is the electron mass and \(m_p\) is the mass of the proton.\newline


\bigskip the second term is the Coulombic potential energy for attraction between charges of a single electron and nucleus of charge Z at distance r. We can call this term \textit{V}.\newline
}
\only<2>{
\medskip The first term is the kinetic energy term, \(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu}\bigtriangledown^2\), which we can call \textit{T}. It is given by the \textit{Laplacian}, \(\bigtriangledown^2\):\newline

\[ \bigtriangledown^2 = \frac{1}{r^2sin\Theta}\left[sin\Theta\frac{\delta}{\delta r}\left(r^2\frac{\delta}{\delta r}\right) + \frac{\delta}{\delta\Theta}\left(sin\Theta\frac{\delta}{\delta\Theta}\right) + \frac{1}{sin\Phi}\frac{\delta^2}{\delta\Phi^2}\right]\]

\bigskip where r = distance of point P from origin\newline
\(\Theta\): co-latitude\newline
\(\Phi\): azimuth\newline

\medskip \textbf{The potential and kinetic energy terms are
added together to form the Hamiltonian, H = T + V}
}
\end{frame}

\subsection{The hydrogen atom}

% Hndwritten notes H1-H3 here in frame
The hydrogen atom (as well as hydrogen-like atoms which have only one electron) is
unique in that it has only a single electron – this means that there are no interactions
between multiple electrons in the system. This greatly simplifies solving the Schrödinger
equation, which can be solved analytically in the case of the hydrogen atom, but must be
analysed using numerical methods in the case of multi-electron atoms. Despite these
differences between hydrogen and other atoms, the hydrogen atom provides a useful
starting point for describing the energies and spatial distribution of electrons in orbitals,
as well as the introducing the quantum numbers needed to study the describe the state of
the atom. We will see that much of the focus in describing the state of atoms depends on
careful consideration of the angular momentum of the electrons. Once the atom is
accurately described, we can then consider the selection rules governing transitions
between different states in a given atom.

The hydrogen atom has a single electron and a nucleus. The quantum mechanical model
of the system needs to describe the kinetic and potential energies in the system. For a
single electron interacting with a nucleus of charge Z, the potential energy is described by
the Coulombic potential.


The solutions to the Schrödinger equation (see section \ref{schrod}) give us both the possible energies of the
system, as well as the possible wavefunctions. As with other quantum mechanical
problems, we find that quantum numbers arise that are needed to describe various aspects
of the solution.\newline

\medskip The possible energies of the Hydrogen atom are:
\[E_n = -\frac{Z^2\mu e^4}{32\pi^2\varepsilon^2_0\hbar^2n^2}\]
\medskip where n is the \textit{principal quantum number}, n = 1, 2, 3, ...
The other quantum numbers that are required to describe the electron \textit{orbitals} are the orbital angular momentum quantum number, \(\ell\), (also termed the azimuthal quantum number) and the magnetic quantum number, \(m_l\). We talked about these in section \ref{quantno} where their possible values are given.

These numbers describe the \textit{orbital}, but to describe the electron fully we also need the \textit{electron spin quantum number}, \(m_s\)

\subsection{Atoms with multiple electrons}

The hydrogen atom provides us with a useful initial
model of atomic energy levels, orbital shapes, and the
quantum numbers needed to describe the system. For
multi-electronic atoms, solving the Schrödinger
equation becomes much more complex because we now
need to account not only for Coulombic interactions
between the nucleus and more electrons, but we also
must account for electron-electron repulsion. In this
case, exact solutions are no longer possible. As a first
result, we find that the interactions between electrons
lifts the degeneracy of the hydrogenic energy levels.
Thus, 2s and 2p orbitals no longer have the same
energy as they do in the hygrogen atom. In this case,
we find that the s orbitals are lower in energy than the p
orbitals. This effect arises because s electrons are closer to the nucleus than p electrons,
and the influence of electron-electron repulsion is relatively small compared to the
electron-nucleus interaction.

The order in which electrons fill available orbitals within
an atom is determined by the Aufbau principle (German:
“building up”), in which electrons are placed in the
lowest available energy level.

In filling the orbitals, we also need to take into account
the Pauli exclusion principle, which we can state as: \begin{quotation}
No two electrons can have the same four quantum
numbers (n, \(\ell\), \(m_\ell\), \(m_s\)) \end{quotation}
Another expression of the Pauli exclusion principle is
that there can be a maximum of two electrons per orbital
and that their spins must be antiparallel.

Once we have obtained the correct electron configuration by placing all available
electrons in the correct orbitals, we are now in a position to describe the state of the atom.
Doing so is requires careful consideration of the angular momentum of
the system.

\bigskip For a \underline{Polyelectronic atom}:\newline
\[ H=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\sum_i\bigtriangledown^2 - \sum_i\frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_ir} + \sum_{i<j}\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r_{ij}}\]

\medskip This equation contains summations over all electrons, i, and there is now a \textit{third} term. The new terms due to Coulombic \textit{repulsion} between pairs of electrons at distance \(r_{ij}\)

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Energy of polyelectronic atoms}
\only<1>{\bigskip Consider an atom that contains a nucleus of mass \(m_n\) with a positive charge of \textit{+Ze} and \textit{N} electrons. 

\medskip This means we have N+1 particles that can all have kinetic energy. The quantum mechanical Hamiltonian will therefore have \textbf{N+1 kinetic energy terms} of the form \(-\hbar/(2m)\bigtriangledown^2\). Each of the electrons will be attracted to the positively charged nucleus. 
\medskip The \textbf{attractive coulombic interactions} will lead to \textbf{N terms} in the potential of the general form \(-Ze^2/r_i\), where \(r_i\) is the distance of electron \textit{i} from the nucleus. We use electrostatic units to avoid having to put the factor \(4\pi\varepsilon_0\) in the denominator. 
}
\only<2>{
\medskip Each pair of electrons with the same charge will experience a \textbf{repulsive interaction} that produces a potential term of the form \(e^2/r_{ij}\), where \(r_{ij}\) is the distance between electrons \textit{i} and \textit{j}. 

\medskip The number of such pairwise interactions is the number of combinations of N objects two at a time: \(C(N,2) = \frac{N!}{(N-2)!(2)!} = \frac{N(N-1)}{2}\). 


\medskip For the Lithium atom, with three electrons, there are 3(2)/2 = 3 repulsion terms. \textbf{For Sodium, with 11 electrons, there are 11(10)/2 = 55 terms}. 

\medskip The Hamiltonian for the sodium atom will therefore contain 12 kinetic energy terms, 11 nuclear-electron attraction terms and 55 electron-electron repulsion terms.
}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Born-Oppenheimer approximation}
\only<1>{
For polyelectric atoms the equation can only be solved by approximation. 

\smallskip One such approximation is called the \textbf{\textit{Born-Oppenheimer}} approximation. 

\smallskip This notes that the mass of the nucleus in the nuclear-electron attraction term is much larger than the electron mass. 

\smallskip The large mass means that the nucleus is movinig very slowly compared to the lighter electrons. 

\smallskip We therefore assume that we can remove the kinetic energy terms for the nuclei from the Hamiltonian. We can separate the problems of nuclear and electronic motions.
}

\only<2>{
\medskip \textbf{\textit{The Hartree approximation}} assumes that the electrons are independent, and interact only via the mean-field Coulomb potential. 

This yields one-electron Schrödinger equations:

\[H \approx -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\sum_i\bigtriangledown^2 - \sum_i\frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_ir} + \sum_iV(r_i)\]
}

\only<3>{
\medskip We're not going to worry about the Hamiltonian any more. 

\smallskip But we can note that 
The ORBITAL energies, \(E_i\) vary with the principal quantum number n, but also with orbital angular momentum quantum number \(\ell\) (=0,1,2,...).
}
\end{frame}

%Orbital energies vary with the principal quantum number, n, but also with orbital angular momentum quantum number \(\ell\).

\subsubsection{The Schrödinger equation}
\label{schrod}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Schrödinger's wave function}
\only<1>{
The potential and kinetic energy terms are
added together to form the Hamiltonian, H = T + V, and inserted in the time-independent
Schrödinger equation:

\begin{align*}
-\hbar^2\frac{\delta^2\Psi}{\delta x^2} &= p^2\Psi\\
\hat{H}\Psi &= E\Psi
\end{align*}

where:\newline \(\Psi\) is the wavefunction\newline H is the Hamiltonian operator and \newline E is the energy.
}
\end{frame}
We will not talk of the Schrödinger equation again. All we need to know is that the Schrödinger wave function defines the behaviour of the electron in three dimensions, and that the possible wavefunction solutions to the Schrödinger equation define the orbital shapes, e.g. like those in figure \ref{orbshapes}

\frametitle{The significance of quantum numbers}
So this reminds us of the \underline{physical significance of the quantum numbers:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The principle quantum number, n, indicates the energy of the orbital and its
distance from the nucleus. Smaller values of n mean that the electron is closer
to the nucleus.
\item The orbital angular momentum quantum number, \(\ell\), indicates the shape of the
orbital. Moreover, it also indicates the magnitude of the angular momentum
of the electron in the orbital and the associated magnetic moment of the
orbital.
\item The magnetic quantum number, \(m_\ell\), indicates the orientation in space of the
orbital. Specifically, it indicates the direction of the angular momentum and of
the associated magnetic moment of the orbital.

\par\medskip Electronic spectroscopy of a molecule is linked to its \emph{energy levels}, which are determined by structure and chemical composition \(\implies\) UV-Vis spectroscopy is a useful tool for identifying molecules. 

\par\medskip Bond lengths and chemical reactivity of excited-state species can be quite different from the ground states.

In an electronic transition there is a transition moment, \(R_{nm}\) from the wavefunctions \(\Psi_m\) and \(\Psi_n\) of the combining states.\newline

\medskip For interactions with the electric component of the radiations, \(\mu\) = electric dipole moment \(= \sum_iq_ir_i\)\newline

\medskip VIBRONIC TRANSITIONS: Vibrational transition accompanying an electronic transition. The vibronic transtion moment, \(R_{ev}\):
\[ R_{ev} = \int\Psi^{`*}_{ev}\mu\Psi^{``}_{ev}d\tau_{ev}\]

\medskip \(\Psi^{'}\) and \(\Psi^{``}\) are the vibronic wave functions of the upper (\(\Psi^{'}\)) and lower (\(\Psi^{``}\)) states. \newline

\medskip Remember the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (Section \ref{poly}). This assumes that \(\Psi_{ev} = \Psi_e\Psi_v\).\newline
}
\only<3>{
\medskip This is useful because we can write:

\[R_{ev} = \int\int\Psi^{`*}_e\Psi^{`*}_v\mu\Psi^{``}_e\Psi^{``}_vd\tau_{ev}dr\]

\medskip If we integrate this with respect to electron coordinates \(\tau_e\) we get:

\[R_{ev} = \int\Psi^{`*}_vR_e\Psi^{``}_vdr\]

\medskip where r is the internuclear distance and \(R_e\) is the electronic transition moment, \(R_e = \int\Psi^{`*}_e\mu\Psi^{``}_ed\tau_e\)
}
\only<4>{
\medskip This is useful because the Born-Oppenheimer approximation lets us assume that the nuclei can be regarded as stationary. In the equation this means that \(R_e\) can be moved outside the integral (because it is independent of r)

\[R_{ev} = R_e\int\Psi^{`*}_v\Psi^{``}_vdr\]

\medskip The integral in this equation is the \textit{Vibrational overlap integral}\newline
\medskip The overlap is a measure of how much the two vibrational wave functions overlap. The square of the integral is the \textbf{Frank-Condon factor}.

Electronic transitions occur when electrons transition between orbitals. If we know the quantum numbers of all the electrons in the atom we can generate some descriptive \emph{terms} that help us describe its overall electronic structure with some simple symbols.

\medskip These \textit{Terms} help us describe electronic transitions because they give us a language to describe the before and after state with symbols. A bit like describing chess moves. 

\medskip For example, the move Qe1-g3 means the white queen moves from position e1 to g3 on the board. We will see there is a similar way of describing how electrons move between orbitals.

\medskip The term symbols contain information on angular momenta and spin quantum number of atoms, or molecules. So first we have to deal with these angular momenta.

\subsection{Angular momenta and Spin-orbit interactions}

\frametitle{What is Angular momentum?}
\only<1>{Angular momentum is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum. \textit{Linear} momentum is the product of mass and linear speed, \(p = mv\).

So if one electron has two kinds of angular momentum, which are vector quantities, then it follows that there must be a resultant angular momentum that we can call the total angular momentum for that electron.\par

Like the two angular momenta, the total angular momentum has a \textit{direction} and a \textit{magnitude}.\par

\medskip The \emph{magnitude} of the \textbf{Total (orbital + spin) angular momentum}, \(\jmath\), is: \[ [\jmath(\jmath+1)]^{1/2}\hbar\]

The term expression is given by \(^{2S+1}L_J\) \newline

\bigskip In this expression, S is the total spin (which is always equal to 1/2), L is the orbital angular momentum (for single electron equal to \(\ell\)).\newline

\medskip The symbols corresponding to the possible values of L (= 0,1,2,3,4,...) are S, P, D, F, G, ...\newline

\medskip This means that for Hydrogen, with one electron, the spin \(s=1/2\) and \(\ell=0\), the Term Expression is given by s=1/2 and \(\ell=0\) and \(\jmath = 1/2 + 0\). \newline

\medskip The Term symbol for the H-atom is therefore:
\[^{2S+1}L_J = ^{2s+1}\ell_\jmath = ^{2/2 + 1}0_{1/2} \implies ^2S_{1/2}\]

Having more than one electron in an atom raises the issues of the indistinguishability of electrons, the electron spin, and the interaction between orbital and spin magnetic moments.

}

\only<2>{
Remember that a configuration specifies only the \textit{n} and \(\ell\) values for the electrons and not the \(m_\ell\) and \(m_s\) values.

\medskip For many atoms, the configuration does not completely define the quantum state. 

\medskip Under what circumstances do the values of \(m_\ell\) and \(m_s\) for a given configuraiton lead to different spatial distributions of electrons and therefore to a different electron-electron repulsion?

\medskip This occurs when there are at least two electrons in the valence shell and then there are multiple choices in \(m_\ell\) and \(m_s\) for these electrons consistent with the Pauli principle and the configuration.
}

\only<3>{
This is not the case for the ground states of the rare gases, the alkali metals, the alkaline earth metals, group III and the halogens. 

\medskip Atoms in all of these groups have either a filled shell or subshell or only one electron or one electron fewer than the maximum number of electrons in a subshell. 

\medskip None of these atoms has more than one unpaired electron in its ground state and all are uniquely described by their configuration

\medskip However, the ground states for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are not completely described by a configuration.
}

\only<4>{
Several quantum states, all of which are consistent with the configuration, have significantly different values for the total energy as well as different chemical reactivities.

\medskip For atoms with Z \(<\) 40, the total energy is essentially independent of \(M_L\) and \(M_S\)

\medskip Therefore, a group of different quantum states that have the same values for L and S but different values of \(M_L\) and \(M_S\) is degenerate in energy

\medskip Such a group of states is called a \textit{term}, and the L and S values for the term are indicated by the \textbf{term symbol} \(^{(2S+1)}L\)
}

\only<5>{
Because there are 2L + 1 quantum states (different \(M_L\) values) for a given value of L and 2S + 1 states (diferent \(M_S\) values) for a given value of S, a term will include (2L + 1)(2S + 1) quantum states, all with the same energy to a good approximation

\medskip This is the \textbf{degeneracy of a term}. The superscript 2S + 1 is called the \textbf{multiplicity}, and the words \textit{singlet} and \textit{triplet} refer to 2S + 1 = 1 and 3, respectively.

\medskip For a filled subshell or shell,
\[ M_L = \sum_i m_{li} = M_S = \sum_i m_{si} = 0\]

and \(M_L = 0\) and \(M_S = 0\) are only consistent with L = 0 and S = 0
}

\only<6>{
Therefore all atoms with no unpaired electrons that have either a filled valence subshell or shell are characterised by the term \(^1S\)

\medskip Note that the term symbol does not depend on the principal quantum number of the valence shell

\medskip Carbon, which has the \(1s^22s^22p^2\) configuration, has the same set of terms as silicon, which has the \(1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^2\) configuration.

Atomic spectroscopies give information on the discrete energy levels of an atom and provide the basis for understanding the coupling of the individual spin and orbital angular momentum vectors in a many-electron atom. Because the discrete energy levels for atoms differ, atomic spectorscopies give information on the identity and concentration of atoms in a sample. For this reason, atomic spectroscopies are widely used in analytical chemistry. The discrete energy spectra of atoms and the difference in rates of transition between quantum states can be used to construct lasers that provide and intense and coherent source of monochromatic radiation. Atomic spectroscopies can also provide elemental identification specific to the first fewa atomic layers of a solid. The reactions of electronically excited atoms can differ dramatically from their ground-state counterparts, as evidenced by reactions in Earth's atmosphere.

\subsection{Coupling of Angular Momenta in multi-electron atoms}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Coupling of angular momenta}
Momenta interact with each other.\newline\bigskip
The stronger the momentum, the stronger the interaction (called coupling)

Spin-orbit coupling is the interaction between the spin of one electron with i) the spins of other electrons, ii) its own orbital motion and iii) orbital motions of other electrons. Sometimes one of these types of interactions is the dominant one and it can be assumed that the other types have negligible contributions.
\par\bigskip
Spin-Orbit coupling approximation regimes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{jj}-coupling 
\item \(\ell\ell\)-coupling 
\item \(ss\)-coupling
\item LS-coupling
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsubsection{jj-coupling}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{\textit{jj}-coupling}
Spin momenta (i) coupling is too weak and orbital momenta coupling too weak. 

\medskip But the spin of electron 1 and angular momentum of electron 1 are strong enough to be appreciable. 

\medskip The interactions between the \textit{j}s of the electrons are appreciable
\end{frame}

\subsubsection{\(\ell\ell\)-coupling}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{\(\ell\ell\)-coupling}
\only<1>{
This neglects the coupling between the spin on electron 1 and its orbital angular momentum. Assumes strong interaction between orbital momenta. Assumes appreciable interaction between spin momenta. 

\bigskip When you have non-equivalent electrons (different n or \(\ell\)), consider strong coupling between orbital angular momenta (\(\ell\ell\)-coupling).\newline

\medskip For example, the He atom \(2p^13d^1\) configuration (highly excited). This gives rise to P, D and F-terms (see below for explanation).

\medskip For this configuration, the values of \(\ell_1 = 1\) and \(\ell_2 = 2\). \par

\medskip So the relative orientations of \(\ell_1\) and \(\ell_2\) are restricted by the values that L can take. The resultant vector \(\overrightarrow{L}\) has to be the same as the sum of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{\ell_1}\) and \(\overrightarrow{\ell_2}\)\par

\section{Molecular Term Symbols}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Term Symbols for molecules}
\only<1>{
The electronic state configuration for \textit{molecules} is described by:

\begin{itemize}
%\item The primary quantum number, n
\item The angular momentum quantum number, \(\Lambda\)
\item The spin quantum number, S
\item The quantum number \(\Sigma\) (S, S-1, ... , -S)
\item The projection of the total angular momentum quantum number onto the molecular symmetry axis, \(\Omega = \Lambda + \Sigma\)
\end{itemize}

Note: The molecular \(\Sigma\) is equivalent to \(M_S\) in atoms\newline

\medskip So the term symbol for molecules takes the form:\newline

\[^{2S+1}\Lambda^{(\pm)}_{\Omega,(^g/_u)}\]
}

\only<2>{
The \textbf{\textit{total angular momentum, \(\Omega\))}} has two contributions:

\medskip 1. \enspace \textit{Electron's orbital angular momentum, \(\Lambda\)}\newline
2. \enspace \textit{Electron's spin angular momentum, \(\Sigma\)}

\medskip Both (1) and (2) are along the z-axis (or let's assume that for now)
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{../../graphics/omega}

\only<3>{
\frametitle{Term Symbols for molecules}
Only unfilled subshells need to be considered\newline
\underline{1st and 2nd row diatomic molecules:}\newline
The molecular orbitals (MOs) are either \( \sigma\) or \(\pi\)-type. Quantum numbers \(m_{li}\) and \(m_{si}\) can be added to generate \(M_L\) and \(M_S\) because they are scalars.
\[ M_L = \sum^n_{i=1}m_{li} \ ,\ M_S=\sum^n_{i=1}m_{si}\]
\(m_{li},\ m_{si}\): z-components for \(m_l\) and \(m_s\) in the \(i^{th}\) electron
}
\end{frame}

The value of the quantum number \(\mathbf{\Lambda}\) is related to the \textit{symmetry of the electron distribution} with respect to the molecular axis.

The value of the quantum number \(\mathbf{\Sigma}\) equals the \textit{total electron spin component along the z-axis}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parity and reflection: g/u and +/-}
\only<1>{
\textbf{Parity} refers to the symmetry around the center of inversion. A symmetry operation starting at an arbitratry point in the orbital and travelling straight through the center of inversion and continuing an equal distance out from the center.

\medskip If the phase is the same the orbital is designated \textbf{g}, for gerade (even) and if the phase is the same, the orbital is designated \textbf{u} for ugerade, or uneven.

\medskip To determine if a state is \textit{g} or \textit{u}, find the parity of each individual open-shell electron and use the rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item \( g + g \rightarrow g\)
\item \(g + u \rightarrow u\)
\item \(u + u \rightarrow g\)
\end{itemize}
}

\only<2>{
What is the parity of the state \(1\sigma^2_g1\sigma^2_u2\sigma^2_g2\sigma^2_u2\pi^1_u2\pi^1_u\)?

\medskip Both open shell electrons are \textit{u}, uneven. According to the rule, that means the overall parity is \textit{g}.

\medskip Bonding sigma-orbitals and anti-bonding pi-orbitals are always \textit{g}. Anti-bonding sigma and bonding pi are always \textit{u}.
}

\only<3>{
\textbf{Reflection} determines if a given orbital is symmetric or anti-symmetric with respect to a plane that containes both nuclei

\medskip When an orbital is symmetric, it is labeled +. When an orbital is anti-symmetric, it is labeled -.

\medskip To find the overall reflection of a state, use the rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item \((+)(+) \rightarrow +\)
\item \((+)(-) \rightarrow -\)
\item \((-)(-) \rightarrow +\)
\end{itemize}
}

\only<4>{
What is the reflection of the state \(1\sigma^2_g1\sigma^2_u2\sigma^2_g2\sigma^2_u2\pi^1_u2\pi^1_u\) ?

\section{Electronic selection rules}

\begin{frame}{What are selection rules?}
Selection rules describe the rules for which electronic transistions are \emph{allowed}. 
\end{frame}

\subsection{Selection rules for Atoms}

We say that the change in energy resulting from electronic transitions between states give rise to photon of energy \(\Delta E\). The frequency \(\nu\) is governed by the \textit{Bohr frequency condition:} \(h\nu = \Delta E\).

But this doesn't take into account angular momentum, so it is not the whole story. Photons possess angular momentum, just like electrons do. So the overall angular momentum has to be preserved in a transition as well. Therefore the electronic angular momentum must change by an amount that compensates for what is carried away by the spinning photon.

So an electron in a d-orbital (\(\ell = 2\)) cannot drop down into an s-orbital (\(\ell=0\)) with an emission of a photon because the emitted photon cannot carry away enough angular momentum. But a d-electron \textit{can} drop down to a p-orbital because \(\ell\) changes by 1 and the balance of the angular momentum can be carried away by the photon.

So some transitions are \textit{allowed} and others are \textit{forbidden}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Selection Rules for Atoms}
\only<1>{
As a reminder, the atomic term symbols are described by the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The primary quantum number n
\item the angular momentum quantum number L
\item the spin quantum number S
\item the \textbf{total} angular momentum quantum number J
\end{itemize}

The final result is a term symbol of the form: \quad \(^{2S+1}L_J\)
}

\only<2>{
\medskip The selection rules are a set of rules that determine what changes in these numbers are allowed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\Delta S = 0\)
\item \(\Delta L = 0,\pm 1\), but the L = 0 \(\leftrightarrow\) L = 0 transition is forbidden
\item \(\Delta J = 0, \pm 1\), but the J = 0 \(\leftrightarrow\) J = 0 transition is forbidden
\item \(\Psi_{initial}\) and \(\Psi_{final}\) must change in parity. \(\sum \ell_i\) odd or even. Only even \(\leftrightarrow\) transitions are allowed
\end{enumerate} 

Electronic spectra show the energies of the different transitions. Any transition, or peak, in a spectrum is associated with a change between two states described by different term symbols.
}

\only<3>{
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\Delta S= 0\)
\item \(\Delta L = 0, \ \pm 1\), but \(L = 0 \leftrightarrow L=0\) transition forbidden
\item \(\Delta J = =0, \ \pm 1\), but \(J=0 \leftrightarrow J=0\) transition forbidden
\item \(\Psi_{initial}\) and \(\Psi_{final}\) must change in \emph{parity}. \(\sum \ell_i\) odd or even. only even \(\leftrightarrow\) odd transitions allowed.
