\section*{Scope of this document}
This document contains \emph{all} the material relevant to the photochemistry section of the CM4019 Exam, \emph{including} directed study material. What that means is that everything that is covered in the lectures is contained in this document, and some additional material not covered by lectures, which makes up the directed study section. 

In other words, this is the only document that is mandatory reading. But the optional reading material provided separately is recommended to assist your understanding of the material.

The problems and exercises at the end will help prepare you for the exam questions, so make sure you can solve them.

 \begin{description}
  \item[Photochemistry:] Photochemistry is concerned with the chemical effects of light. Generally, this term is used to      describe a chemical reaction caused by absorption of ultraviolet (\(\lambda\) = 100-400 nm), visible light (\(\lambda\) = 400-750 nm) or infrared radiation (\(\lambda\) = 750-2500 nm)
  \item[Excited state of a molecule:] Energy of the molecule has increased by the energy of the absorbed photon \\
  
 \end{description}
\end{frame}

The normal electronic configuration of any molecule is called the \textbf{ground state}. Energy from absorbed light is used to promote an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the ground state (\(\psi_2\)) into the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the excited state (\(\psi_3^*\)). A species with a promoted electron is called an \emph{excited state}. The \(\psi_3^*\) becomes the HOMO of the excited state. \emph{The HOMOs of the ground state and the excited sate have opposite symmetries.}

\subsection{Singlet and Triplet excited states}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Singlet and Triplet excited states}
	When an electron in a molecule with a singlet ground state is excited (via absorption of radiation) to a higher energy level, 		either an excited singlet state or an excited triplet state will form

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\begin{alertblock}{Excited states}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An excited singlet state is a molecular electronic state such that all electrons are paired. Multiplicity is 1
		\item In an excited triplet state the excited electron is no longer paired with the ground state electron; that is, they are 			  parallel (same spin). Multiplicity is 3
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{multiplicity}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Multiplicity}
	Singlet and triplet states have different \emph{multiplicity} \\
	
	The multiplicity of and energy level is defined as \textbf{2S + 1}, where S is the \emph{total spin angular momentum} \newline
	
	\LARGE Spin selection rules:\newline \normalsize
	An electronic transition is allowed by the spin selection rule only if the multiplicity of the initial and final states are 				identical, \textit{e.g.} \newline
	\begin{center} \fbox{
\begin{tabular}{c c c}
	S \(\rightarrow\) S & T \(\rightarrow\) T &  are \alert{allowed}\\
	S \(\rightarrow\) T & T \(\rightarrow\) S &  are \alert{forbidden}

				\item The transition will usually occur from the loweest (ground) electronic state (\(S_0\)) due to the 								statistical mechanical issues of most electrons occupying a low lying state at reasonable temperatures
				\item Absorbance is a very fast transition, on the order of \emph{\(10^{-15}\) seconds}
				\item As excitation to a triplet state involves a ``forbidden'' spin transition, it is less probable when the 							molecule absorbs radiation
			\end{itemize}

				\item This relaxation occurs between vibrational levels, so generally electrons will not change from one 								electronic level to another}
				\only<2->{\item This kinetic energy may stay within the same molecule, or it may be transferred to other molecules 							around the excited molecule, largely depending on the phase of the probed sample}

				\item Internal conversion occurs because of the overlap of vibrational and electronic energy states
				\item At energy levels grater than \(S_1\), the manifold of vibrational energy levels strongly overlap with the 						electronic energy levels}
				\only<2>{\item This overlap gives a higher degree of probability that the electron can transition between vibrational 							levels that will lower the electronic state, and is fast (on the order of \emph{\(10^{-6} to 10^{7}\) 							seconds}
				\item Due to a lack of vibrational and electronic energy state overlap and large energy difference, internal 							conversion is slow (\emph{\(10^{-6}\) to \(10^{-7}\) seconds}) between \(S_0\) and \(S_1\)}

				\item Fluoresence is a slow process, on the order of \(10^{-7} to 10^{-9}\) seconds}
				\only<2>{\item Fluorescence is most often observed between the \(S_1\) and \(S_0\) as at higher energies it is more 							likely that energy will be dissipated through internal conversion and vibrational relaxation
				\item The energy of fluorescent photons is almost always less than that of the exciting photons
				\item The difference is because energy is lost in internal conversion and vibrational relaxation, where it is 							transferred away from the electron}

\frametitle{The absorption process}
\begin{itemize}
\item The absorption process is the process by which light interacts with matter to create an excited state
\item Generally in photochemistry we use \textit{\underline{electromagnetic radiation}} to create excited electronic state of molecules
\item Then \textit{\underline{photochemical}} (dissociation, isomerization) or \textit{\underline{photophysical}} (luminescence, etc.) processes subsequently occur
\item Our picture of wave-like properties is due to Maxwell, where light can be thought of as a transverse plane involving \textit{\underline{electric and magnetic fields aligned at \(90^\circ\)}} to each other
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Radiation and scattering}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{red}{Electromagnetic radiation}} causes electrons to be set into oscillation by the electric vector of the wave
\item If the energy does not correspond to the energy difference between two stationary states of the atom the duration of the interaction is of the order of \(\approx 10^{-14}\) seconds and phenomena such as \textit{\underline{Ralyleigh scattering}} take place
\item[] \includegraphics[height=2in]{../graphics/rayleigh}
\item Rayleigh scattering occurs when the radius of the scattering object (e.g. an atom) is much smaller than the wavelength of light 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item However, the \textbf{\underline{wave-particle duality}} of light should not be forgotten
\item The \(19^{th}\) century pure wave theory of light is an oversimplification
\item The energy of a beam of light comes in finite chunks rather than being spread smoothly throughout a region of space
\item Thus, electromagnetic radiation is viewed as a stream of \textit{\underline{discrete particles of energy}} called \textbf{\color{red}photons}
\item In essence, a photon can be thought of as a particle with energy but \textit{\underline{no mass}}

\item[]
\[ \Phi\lambda = \frac{\textit{Rate of formation}}{I_a} \]
where \(I_a\) = no. photons absorbed/unit volume/unit time and 1 Einstein = 1 mole of photons}
\only<3>{\small \item For a \textit{\underline{luminescence}} process:
\[ \Phi_F \ or\  \Phi_P = \frac{\textit{No. quanta emitted}}{\textit{No. quanta absorbed}} = \frac{\textit{rate of emission of luminescence}}{\textit{rate of absorption}} \] }

The intensity of the fluorescence will depend on the ability of the solvent to accept the electronic anc vibrational quanta. Solvents with molecules with widely spaced vibrational levels (such as water) can in some cass accept the large quantum of electronic energy between ground and excited state and so extinguish, or ``quench'', the fluorescence.

In chemical actinometry, the incident light is measured by monitoring a chemical reaction, like in the following example.
\begin{example}
The intensity of the incident light is measured by the decomposition of oxalic acid, \ce{(COOH)2} in the presence of uranyl sulfate (\ce{(UO2)SO4})

Light is absorbed leading to an excited state which causes decomposition of the oxalic acid:\\\hspace{5pt}

1) \ce{UO2+ + h$\nu$ -> (UO2+)^*}\\
2) \ce{(UO2+)^* + (COOH)2 -> UO2+ + H2O + CO2 + CO}\\\hspace{5pt}

For this reaction, \(\Phi = 0.53\), so we'll use quantum yield to determine the rate of incident photons.

\medskip The reaction takes place in a solvent (methanol) and there is a quencher, Q, present (Triethylamine)

\medskip The half-life, \(t_{1/2}\), of the fluorescence without quencher is 29 \(\mu s\)

\medskip What is the value of \(k_q\)?}

\only<2>{To solve the problem, summarise what we know:

0.0010 & 0.41\\
0.0050& 0.25\\
0.0100 & 0.16\\\hline
\end{tabular}
Half-life = \(t_{1/2}= 29 \mu s\)

\medskip Remember, half-life, \(t_{1/2}\) is NOT the same as the lifetime, \(\tau_f\), but \(\tau_f = \frac{ln2}{t_{1/2}}\) (why? because \(I_f\) decays as \(e^{-k_ft} = e^{-t/\tau_f}\) in the absence of quencher)

The processes are: 

\smallskip

Quenching & \(k_q\) & \(k_q[S_1^*][Q]\)\\\hline

The emission has been measured under constant irradiation, so measurements are made during steady state process:

\smallskip \begin{multline*}\frac{d[S_1^*]}{dt} = k_a[S_1^*] - k_f[S_1^*] - k_q[S_1^*]\\

That means

\([S_1^*] = \frac{I_a}{k_f + k_q[Q]}\), and \(I_f = k_f[S_1^*] = \frac{k_q[Q]}{k_fI_a}\)


So if we measure \(I_f\) at different concentrations of Q, we can plot 1/\(I_f\) vs. [Q]

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Intersystem crossing} (ISC) is the \emph{non-radiative} transition of an electron between two states of different \underline{multiplicity} (\(\Delta S \neq 0\)) \includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{../graphics/intersystem}
\item It is the energy gap between S and T which controls the efficiency of intersystem crossing
\item Large gap -- small \(k_{ISC}\) and vice versa
\item If the gap is large, there will be a great difference in charge densities \(\implies\) can expect a large reactivity difference between S and T
\item If the gap is small, the difference in charge distribution for S and T will be small \(\implies\) can expect similar singlet-triplet chemical reactivities
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

The singlet and triplet excited states share a common geometry at the point where their potential energy curves intersect. If there is a mechanism for unpairing two electron spins (and acheiving the conversion of \ce{ ^ v} to \ce{ ^ ^}), the molecule may undergo \textbf{intersystem crossing} and become a tripelt state. If an excited molecule crosses into a triplet state, it continues to deposit energy into the surroundings. But it is now stepping down the triplet's vibrational ladder, and at the lowest energy level it is trapped because the triplet state is at a lower energy than the corresponding singlet (remember Hund's rule from CM3016). The solvent cannot absorb the final, large quantum of electronic excitation energy and the molecule cannot radiate its energy because return to the ground state is spin-forbidden.

The radiative transition, however, is not totally forbidden because the spin-orbit coupling that that was responsible for the intersystem crossing also breaks the selection rule. The molecules are therefore able to emit weakly, and the emission may continue long after the original excited state was formed.

This mechanism also suggests that phosphorescence should be most intense from solid samples, because energy transfer is then less efficient and intersystem crossing has time to occur as the singlet excited state steps slowly past the intersection point.

The mechanism also suggests that the phosphorescence efficiency should depend on the presence of a moderately heavy atom (with strong spin-orbit coupling).

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why do compounds in which the lowest excited singlet state is n\(\pi^*\) in nature not usually fluoresce strongly?}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item \emph{Little overlap of orbitals} (\(n \rightarrow \pi^*\)) in the same region of space
\item Less orbital overlap leads to \emph{less coulombic repulsion}
\item Less coulombic repulsion causes \emph{less singlet-triplet (S-T) splitting}
\item More singlet/triplet mixing means that:\\
\hspace{10pt} \(S_1 \rightarrow T_n\) intersystem crossing is efficient (\(k_{ISC}\) is large)\\
\hspace{10pt} \(S_1 \rightarrow S_0\) internal conversion is comparatively inefficient (\(k_{IC}\) is small)
\item Thus, the singlet state becomes depopulated and the triplet state populated
\item This leads to an \emph{increase} in \(\tau_0\) as S \(\rightarrow\) T processes are spin forbidden
\item Since \(\tau_0 = \frac{1}{k_F}\), as \(\tau_0\) increases, the rate of fluorescence decreases

\frametitle{The three processes are related}
\only<1>{
In a system at equilibrium, the three processes are not independent. If the population of the two states are given by N\(_1\) and N\(_2\), the overall rate of transition from level 1 to level 2 must be the same as that from level 2 to level 1.
\[ B_{12}\rho(\nu)N_1 = B_{21}\rho(\nu)N_2 + A_{21}N_2\]

Where \(\rho(\nu)\) is the radiation density at a given frequency. The spontaneous emission is independent of this, but the rates of absorption and stimulated emission are directly proportional to \(\rho(\nu)\).
}
\only<2>{
\medskip The proportionality constants for this dependence are the the coeficients \(A_{21}\), \(B_{12}\) and \(B_{21}\) and each of these rates is proportional to the number of molecules (\(N_1\) or \(N_2\)) in the state from which the transition originates.

\medskip A signal will not be observed in an absorption experiment unless the lower state is populated, and no emission will be observed in an emission experiment unless the upper state is populated.

\medskip The function for \(\rho(\nu)\) is the blackbody spectral density function, because \(\rho(\nu)\) is the distribution of frequencies at equilibrium for a given temperature.

Einstein concluded that:\[ B_{12} = B_{21}\ and\ \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{16\pi^2\hbar\nu^3}{c^3}\]

\begin{example}
\only<1>{
Derive the equations \(B_{12} = B_{21}\ and\ \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}} = \frac{16\pi^2\hbar\nu^3}{c^3}\) above from two pieces of information (hint: remember something from CM2004):\\
1) the overall rate of transition between levels 1 and 2 is zero at equilibrium\\
2) the ratio of \(N_2\) to \(N_1\) is governed by the Boltzmann distribution\\
\medskip \textbf{Solution:} \newline
1) The fact that the rate of transitions from level 1 to level 2 is equal and opposite to the rate of transitions from level 2 to level 1 gives us the equation: \(B_{12}\rho(\nu)N_1 = B_{21}\rho(\nu)N_2 + A_{21}N_2\)
}
\only<2>{
2) The Boltzmann distribution function states that 
\[\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1}e^{-h\nu/k_BT}\]
In this case \(g_2=g_1\). The two equations can be solved for \(\rho(\nu)\):

\[\rho(\nu) = \frac{A_{21}}{(B_{12}e^{h\nu/k_BT} - B_{21})}\]
Planck has showed that \(\rho(\nu)\) has the form 
\[\rho(\nu,T)d\nu = \frac{8\pi h\nu^3}{c^3}\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_BT}-1}d\nu\]
}
\only<3>{
So from the above we get:\newline
\[\rho(\nu) = \frac{A_{21}}{(B_{12}e^{h\nu/k_BT} - B_{21}}=\frac{8\pi h\nu^3}{c^3}\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_BT}-1}\]

For these two expression to be equal, it is necessary that \[B_{12}=B_{21}\ and\ \frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}}=\frac{8\pi h\nu^3}{c^3} = \frac{16\pi^2\hbar\nu^3}{c^3}\]

Photodissociation of trace species and the subsequent reaction of the photoproducts with other molecules is the prime initiator and driver for the bulk of tropospheric chemistry

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Light in the atmosphere}
\only<1>{
Ozone is very important in tropospheric chemistry. Ozone acts as initiator, reactant and product in much of the oxidation chemistry that takes place in the troposphere.

\medskip Stratospheric ozone determines the amount of short wavelength radiation available to initiate photochemistry.

The light source for photochemistry in the atmosphere is the sun. At the top of the atmosphere there is about 1370 Wm\(^{-2}\) of energy over a wide spectral range.

\smallskip By the time the incident light reaches the troposphere much of the shorter wavelength light has been absorbed, by molecules like oxzygen, water vapour and ozone, or scattered in the atmosphere

\smallskip In the surface layers, typically only light of wavelengths \(>\) 290 nm is available.

\smallskip The light capable of causing photochemical reactions is termed the \textit{actinic flux}, \(F_\lambda(\lambda)\ (cm^{-2}s^{-1}nm^{-1}) = \int L_\lambda(\lambda,\vartheta,\phi)d\omega\)

\subsection{Chemical Actinomtery}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Chemical actinometry}
A chemical actinometer or dosimeter is a chemical system (fluid, gas, solid or in a microheterogeneous
environment) that undergoes a light-induced reaction (at a certain wavelength, \(\lambda\)) for which the quantum yield, \(Phi_\lambda\), is accurately known. Measuring the reaction rate allows the calculation of the absorbed photon flux (the incident photon flux is calculated from the relation N\(_{abs,\lambda} = N_{0,\lambda} (1 â€“ 10^{â€“A\lambda})\), provided that the absorbance A\(_\lambda\) is constant \(\pm\) 10 \% during the irradiation time. Should this not be the case, integration of the differential absorbance over time would be necessary. The easiest case is for \(N_{abs,\lambda} = N_{0,\lambda}\) for total absorption during the whole irradiation period. Determination of conversion to the products affords the total number of photons absorbed by the liquid or gas volume or solid surface which may have any form or geometry.
\end{frame}

 The quantum yield of a photochemical reaction is defined as \(\Phi_\lambda =\) the number of events, e.g. molecules
changed, formed or destroyed, divided by the number of absorbed photons of that particular wavelength in the same
period of time.
 Calibration of an actinometer is done by applying a calibration lamp or by absolute measurement of irradiance
(using, e.g., a calibrated radiometer, a calorimeter, or a photodiode). Photothermal methods are often used to calibrate
actinometers in absolute terms.
 Absolute measurement of incident irradiance (E in W m\(^{-2}\)) or photon irradiance (E\(_p\)) in quanta (\(s^{-1} m^{-2}\) or einstein \(s^{-1} m^{-2}\)) or photon flux, \(N_p\) (einstein s\(^{-1}\)) can be done using precalibrated photodiodes.

\subsection{Snow and Ice}
The optical properties of snow have been studiedwith reference to photochemistry in or on snow and ice. Experiments in polar regions have shown that photochemistryin snow and ice can have a major effect on the biogeochemistry of the atmosphere and snowpacks. There have been manymeasurements of gaseous fluxes of nitrogen oxides from sunlit snowpacks. Laboratory work has demonstrated thatthe source of NOx in snow is the photolysis of the nitrate anion.

Photochemical pathways involving the OH radical in snow-packs are implicated in the production of fluxes of acetaldehyde and  formaldehyde  that  have  been  observed  from  snowpacks. 
\end{frame}

Photochemical pathways involving the OH radical in snow-packs are implicated in the production of fluxes of acetaldehyde and  formaldehyde  that  have  been  observed  from  snowpacks. Many other organic compounds including alkylnitrates, alkenes, halides and organic acids may have a snowpackphotolytic source. Recent work has also demonstrated that organic pollutants contained within snow and ice inpolar regions may photolyse. It is suggested that photochemical reactions of nitrate and hydrogen peroxide may alsobe occurring in sea ice. In sea ice, one could speculate that the OH radical may react with the brine to liberate gaseous halogenspecies that may be responsible for the polar ozone depletionsin Arctic regions.

\subsection{Polar Stratospheric Clouds}
\begin{frame}
PSCs form at very high altitudes, between 15 and 25 km (about 50,000 to 80,000 feet). They consist of ice crystals of water and nitric acid. PSCs only form at very cold temperatures around -78C (-108F). Sometimes, in winter near the North or South Pole, temperatures in the lower stratosphere get that cold. 

\includegraphics[height=2in]{../graphics/PSCrecycling}
\end{frame}

Type II
Nacreous clouds composed of ice crystals with temperatures of ~minus 85ÂºC.
Type I
Less spectacular than nacreous clouds, more diffuse and less bright colours. Sometimes nacreous clouds are embedded in them. Type I clouds are slightly warmer (~ minus 78C) than Type II and are composed of exotic solids or liquid droplets.

Type Ia
Crystalline compounds of water and nitric acid - especially NAT, nitric acid trihydrate \ce{HNO3*3H2O}
Type Ib
Small spherical droplets of a solution of nitric and sulphuric acids.
Type Ic
Small non spherical particles of a metastable nitric acid - water phase
PSCs were long regarded as curiosities and of no real consequence. However, Type I clouds are now known as sites of harmful destruction of stratospheric ozone over the Antarctic and Arctic. Their surfaces act as catalysts which convert more benign forms of man-made chlorine into active free radicals (for example ClO, chlorine monoxide). During the return of Spring sunlight these radicals destroy many ozone molecules in a series of chain reactions. Cloud formation is doubly harmful because it also removes gaseous nitric acid from the stratosphere which would otherwise combine with ClO to form less reactive forms of chlorine.

\section{Photocatalysis}

Photocatalytic reactions are
based on chemical reactions on the surface of the photocatalyst

\subsection{Metal Oxide photocatalysis}

The development of photocatalysis has been the focus of considerable
attention in recent years with photocatalysis being used in a
variety of products across a broad range of research areas, including
especially environmental and energy-related fields.

Following on from the water splitting breakthrough reported by
Fujishima and Honda in 1972, the photocatalytic properties
of certain materials have been used to convert solar energy into
chemical energy to oxidize or reduce materials to obtain useful
materials including hydrogen and hydrocarbons, and to
remove pollutants and bacteria on wall surfaces and in
air and water. Of the many different photocatalysts,
\ce{TiO2} has been the most widely studied and used in many applications
because of its strong oxidizing abilities for the
decomposition of organic pollutants, superhydrophilicity, chemical stability, 
long durability, nontoxicity, low cost, and
transparency to visible light.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{\ce{TiO2}}
\only<1>{
The photocatalytic properties of \ce{TiO2} are derived from the
formation of photogenerated charge carriers (hole and electron)
which occurs upon the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light
corresponding to the band gap.
A fraction of these arrive at the surface where they undergo reduction and oxidation reactions.


\includegraphics[width=3in]{../graphics/bandgap}

}
\only<2>{
The photogenerated holes in the valence band diffuse to the \ce{TiO2} surface and react
with adsorbed water molecules, forming hydroxyl radicals \ce{OH *}
The photogenerated holes and the hydroxyl radicals
oxidize nearby organic molecules on the \ce{TiO2} surface. Meanwhile,
electrons in the conduction band typically participate in reduction
processes, which are typically react with molecular oxygen in the
air to produce superoxide radical anions (\ce{O2^-*}).

There are many factors which can influence photocatalytic performance, including the

Remember: The process of promoting electrons to an excited state is called excitation. When electrons relax from a singlet excited state to a singlet ground state it is called \textit{fluorescence}. When electrons are relaxed from a triplet state to a singlet ground state, it is called \textit{phosphorescence}. 

\medskip Luminescence is classified according to the excited state that gives rise to it ande to the source of energy that caused the excited state to be populated with electrons.

\medskip When the the excitation is the result of energy released in a chemical reaction, the luminescence is called \textbf{chemiluminescence}

What about chemiluminescence quantum yield?

\medskip Chemiluminescence does not depend on absorption of photons

\medskip The intensity of chemiluminescece emission is compared with the number of reactant molecules. It is called the \textit{chemiluminescece quantum yield} (\(\Phi_{CL}\))
\[\Phi_{CL} = \Phi_C\Phi_E\Phi_F\]
where \(\Phi_C\) is the proportion of reactant molecules converted into product, \(\Phi_E\) is the proportion of product molecules formed in the excited state, and \(\Phi_F\) has the usual meaning.

\begin{Exercise}[label = ex1]
Ultraviolet radiation photolyses \ce{O3} to \ce{O2} and O in the reaction \ce{O3 + h$\nu$ -> O2 + O}

Determine the rate at which ozone is consumed by 305 nm radiation in a layer of the stratosphere of thickness 1 km. The quantum yield is 0.94 at 220K, the concentration about \(8\times10^{-9}\ mol\ dm^{-3}\), the molar absorption coefficient is 260 \(dm^3\ mol^{-1}\ cm^{-1}\), and the flux of 305 nm radiation about \(1\times 10^{14}\) photons \(cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}\).

\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref= ex1] The rate of reaction is the rate at which ozone absorbs photons times the quantum yield. The rate at which ozone absorbs photons is the rate at which photons impinge on the ozone times the fraction of photons absorbed. That fraction is 1-T, where T is transmittance. T is related to the absorbance, A, by

\(A=-logT = \varepsilon c \ell\) so \(1-T = 1-10^{-\varepsilon c \ell}\)

\(1-T = 1-10^{-[260\ Lmol^{-1}cm^{-1} \times 8.0\times10^{-9}\ mol\ L^{-1} \times 10^5\ cm]} = 0.38\)

the photochemical chlorination of chloroform

\ce{CHCl3 + Cl2 = CCl4 + HCl}

is believed to proceed by the following mechanism

\ce{Cl2 + h$\nu$ ->[I_a] + 2Cl}

\ce{Cl + CHCl3 ->[k_1] CCl3 +HCl}

\ce{CCl3 + Cl2 ->[k_2] CCl4 + Cl}

\ce{2CCl3 + Cl2 ->[k_3] 2CCl4}

Derive the steady state rate law for the production of carbon tetrachloride.
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref=ex2]
\(\frac{d[CCl_4]}{dt} = k_2[CCl_3][Cl_2] + 2k_3[CCl_3]^2[Cl_2]\)

\(\frac{d[CCl_3]}{dt} = k_1[Cl][CHCl_3] - k_2[CCl_3][Cl_2] - 2k_3[CCl_3]^2[Cl_2] = 0\)

\(\frac{d[Cl]}{dt} = 2I_a - k_1[Cl][CHCl_3] + k_2[CCl_3][Cl_2] = 0\)

Adding the two steady state expresions yields

\(I_a = k_3[CCl_3]^2[Cl_2]\)

this makes it possible to eliminate [CCl\(_3\)] from the first equation to obtain:

\(\frac{d[CCl_4]}{dt} = \frac{k_2I_a^{1/2}[Cl_2]^{1/2}}{k_3^{1/2}} + 2I_a\)

No internal conversion processes are assumed to occur in the molecule.}}
\Answer As no internal conversion processes occur in the molecule (as stated) we assume that only processes that are taking place are \emph{fluorescence, phosphorescence and intersystem crossing}.

The best thing to do with these types of questions is to summarise the data given to you initially:\\

(i) Calculate the rate coefficient for intersystem crossing (\(k_{ISC}\)) from S\textsubscript{1} to T\textsubscript{1}?
\begin{itemize}
\item The competing processes to depopulate S\textsubscript{1} are intersystem crossing and fluorescence
\item \(\Phi_{ISC} = \frac{k_{ISC}}{k_{ISC} + k_F} \xrightarrow{as} \tau_s = \frac{1}{k_{ISC} + k_F} \xrightarrow{therefore} \Phi_{ISC} = k_{ISC} \cdot \tau_s \xrightarrow{re-arrange\ to\ solve\ for\ k_{ISC}} k_{ISC} = \frac{\Phi_{ISC}}{\tau_s}\)
\item As we are talking about intersystem crossing from S\textsubscript{1} tp T\textsubscript{1} then we are populating the triplet state:
\item \(\Phi_{ISC} = \Phi_T \xrightarrow{finally} k_{ISC} = \frac{\Phi_T}{\tau_s} \Rightarrow k_{ISC} = \frac{0.68}{94\times 10^{-9}} = 7.234\times10^6\ s^{-1}\)\\\medskip

(ii) Calculate the quantum efficiency of phosphorescence (\(\Theta_P\)) \\
\[\Phi_p = \Phi_T \cdot \Theta_P\]
Re-arranging to solve for \(\Theta_P\):\\
\begin{align*}
\Rightarrow \Theta_P &= \frac{\Phi_p}{\Phi_T}\\
\Rightarrow \Theta_p &= \frac{0.022}{0.68} = 0.032
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\medskip

(iii) Calculate the rate coefficient of phosphorescence (\(k_p\)) from T\textsubscript{1} to S\textsubscript{0}\\
\smallskip The competing processes to depopulate T\textsubscript{1} are intersystem crossing and phosphorescence
\begin{align*} \Phi_p = \frac{k_p}{k_p + k_{ISC}} \xrightarrow{as} \tau_s &= \frac{1}{k_p + k_{ISC}}\\ \xrightarrow{therefore} \Phi_p &= k_p\tau_T \\\xrightarrow{re-arranging\ to\ solve\ for\ k_p} k_p &= \frac{\Phi_p}{\tau_s}\\ \Rightarrow k_p &= \frac{0.022}{1.7} = 0.0129\ s^{-1}\end{align*}

\medskip
(iv) Calculate the rate coefficient for intersystem crossing from T\textsubscript{1} to S\textsubscript{0}\\
Again, the competing processes to depopulate T\textsubscript{1} are intersystem crossing and phosphorescence\\
\begin{align*}
\Phi_p &= \frac{k_p}{k_p + k_{ISC}}\\ \xrightarrow{re-arranging\ to\ solve\ for\ k_p} k_{ISC} &= \frac{k_p}{\Phi_p} - k_p\\ \Rightarrow k_{ISC} &= \frac{0.0129}{0.022} - 0.0129 = 0.573\ s^{-1}
\end{align*}
